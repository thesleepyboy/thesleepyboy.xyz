                <h1>about me</h1>
                    <p>
                        i run out of patience fairly easy. hello, im ezequiel. im 17 and im from buenos aires argentina.
                        growing up i've always taken an interest in computers, i even tried to start programing at 11
                        years old in 2019 (it was visual basic and i of course had no idea what i was doing but i was 
                        proud of it anyways). i want to study computer science at UBA (universidad de buenos aires) and
                        i already started with the entry course!! AND IM STILL IN HIGH SCHOOL YALL (u can see my progress
                        in <a href="/uni">uni</a>). im also tryna make sum music bc im bored guys nothing serious
                    </p>

                    <h1>experience</h1>
                    <p>
                        as you might have realised im not a professional developer AT ALL. i've tried making some projects
                        like a discord bot which lets you play truco which is a very popular argentine card game and another
                        discord bot to implement pinterest on discord (ofc they rejected my api access request bc why not) and
                        more ofc. if i ever finish one of those projects i promise i'll post it on github but let's stick to
                        this webpage as my only finished public project for the time being
                    </p>
